# 🍽️ Customer Sentiment Analysis & Clustering on Zomato Data using ML 💬📊🤖

A robust Machine Learning project that analyzes customer reviews, classifies sentiment, and clusters restaurants based on metadata to uncover hidden patterns and insights from Zomato datasets.

---

## 🔧 Features

💬 **Sentiment Analysis**
- Classifies customer reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral
- Logistic Regression-based text classification
- Visual analysis of review sentiments by cost, rating, city, and cuisine

📊 **Restaurant Clustering**
- Clusters restaurants using Cuisines and Average Cost
- KMeans clustering with Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- Helps identify similar restaurant groups for marketing or promotions

📈 **15+ Insightful Visualizations**
- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate charts (bar, pie, heatmap, scatter)
- Analysis of cuisines, cost, ratings, and sentiment distributions
- Business impact analysis using UBM Rule (Understand → Build → Measure)

🧠 **ML Model Evaluation**
- Train-test split, confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation insights

📁 **Two Datasets Used**
1. `Zomato Restaurant reviews.csv` – Customer reviews
2. `Zomato Restaurant names and Metadata.csv` – Restaurant info (cuisine, cost, rating, etc.)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF, text preprocessing)
- Logistic Regression (Sentiment Classifier)
- KMeans Clustering (Restaurant grouping)
- Streamlit (for app deployment, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (for model development and submission)
